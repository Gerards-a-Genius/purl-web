# Purl Design System

Welcome to the **Purl Design System** - a comprehensive component library for building knitting companion applications.

## About Purl

Purl is an AI-powered knitting companion that helps knitters:
- **Upload and parse** knitting patterns into step-by-step instructions
- **Track progress** with row counters, stitch counters, and timers
- **Learn techniques** through contextual help and tutorials
- **Get assistance** when stuck with our SOS AI assistant

---

## Design Philosophy

Our design is built on four core pillars:

### 1. Guidance Over Jargon
We use friendly, approachable language that welcomes beginners while respecting experienced knitters. Technical terms are explained in context.

### 2. Just-in-Time Help
Help appears when and where you need it - contextual tooltips, technique explanations, and AI assistance that understands your current project state.

### 3. Calm Structure
A warm, cozy aesthetic with earthy tones that reduces overwhelm. Clear visual hierarchy guides users through complex patterns without anxiety.

### 4. Progress Clarity
Always know where you are - in your current row, in your project, and in your knitting journey. Progress is celebrated at every milestone.
